## ðŸ”– Push/Release Naming Advice

For **commit messages**, keep them descriptive (e.g. `Add copy-to-clipboard feature`).

For **release names or tags**, you can choose between:

### âœ… Option A: `v1.0` or `1.0`
This is the standard and most widely used. Simple and clean.

Examples:
- `v1.0`
- `v1.1.2`

### Option B: `gradient-background-v1.0`
Good if you manage multiple projects in a monorepo or want extreme clarity. But not necessary for small, single-purpose repos.

### âž¤ **Recommendation**:  
Use `v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc. (Versioning only). It follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and is GitHub-standard.
